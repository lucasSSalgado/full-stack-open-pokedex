Choosen language: Rust
    When using Rust looks like there is more then one option for it step in a CI setup. For linting is possible to use the build-in liting tool "Clippy" or a tool named Rustfmt. For the task of testing rust also have a build-in tool call Cargo Test, but is also possible to use Tarpaulin. Building can be done with the Rust package manager and build system, Cargo.
    There are many alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions, like the Gitlab CI/CD, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI, Bitbucket Pipelines, Buddy, AWS CodePipelines, and may other.
    I belive that a cloud-based environment would be a better alternative, I prefer to relly on a stabelish service that is easy to configure and focus on the development task. To make that decision I belive that the most important topic is the experience of the developers, if they already work with a CI/CD cloud-based tool. The convinience over configuration is the argument I use to choose a cloud-based alternative. But I think in some scenarios the self-hosted can be prefer: if you work is high sensible data and don't want to relly on third party programs, or if is a hobby project and dont want to pay for it, etc.
